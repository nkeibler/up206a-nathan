In the draft version of “The value of residential streets” article, Millard-Ball proposes that decision-making on residential street widths should be conducted through an economics framework, in addition to the traffic / civil engineering and urban design frameworks that are traditionally applied to street design. He developed a process to analyze the widths, land areas and land values of residential streets in the U.S.’s 16 largest counties. On average, the findings show that streets are about 56’ wide in the urbanized areas of these counties. Millard-Ball calls for reduced residential street width requirements (ideally 16’), particularly in areas along the coast of California with high land values and housing costs. Ultimately, the decision for what to do with the newly available land (that would traditionally be included in the right-of-way) is left up to developers.  

- Question 1: Has the research you conducted in this paper shifted in any way since the September 2020 draft? 

- Question 2: Is this proposal primarily intended for the replatting of existing residential developments or for the design of new residential developments? 

- Question 3: If the width of a right-of-way in an existing housing subdivision were reduced from 50’ to 16’, that would leave 17’ of space on both sides of the street. Do you imagine that these additional 17’ widths would be added to the existing abutting parcels? Or programmed / zoned for a new use? Given the 17’ constraint, it’s hard to imagine that new housing could be constructed within this zone. 

- Question 4: If narrower street widths allowed for larger parcels on low volume streets, how does one prevent the McMansion effect from accelerating?
