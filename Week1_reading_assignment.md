## [Los Angeles County Homelessness & Housing Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/400d7b75f18747c4ae1ad22d662781a3) 
## **Summary:** 
This article introduces a tool developed by LA County called the “Los Angeles County Homelessness & Housing Map.” This tool shares information about temporary and supportive housing developments within LA County that are currently operating, under construction or in the planning and development phases. Users are given the option to view the data from a larger countywide scale, as well as the ability to zoom in and learn more detailed information about each development, such as “Project Name” or “Total Beds.”

## **Reflection:** 
Since my background is in design, I really appreciate the graphic/visual clarity and conciseness of this tool. I also like how it provides users the option to control the level of detail in the map by zooming in and out at different scales, as well as the ability to click on the shape representing each development to learn more information. It feels easy to navigate as users can “Zoom to” each development to view its exact location and quickly return to the full map by clicking the “Default map view” in the lower right corner. I hope to provide users the same clarity and ease. Lastly, I like that the tool is able to show both existing and future developments in the County and present them through different colors. I do wish that the tool was able to convey how the existing developments compare to the County’s defined goals for interim and supportive housing. This is important information to have on hand so users know that, even though many developments are completed or underway, homelessness is still a dire issue and housing supply needs to increase dramatically to support our unhoused neighbors.
